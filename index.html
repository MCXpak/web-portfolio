        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a studying at Queen Mary University of London finishing my BEng in Robotics Engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          My life's simple pleasures (outside of my hobbies) come from spending way too long on a problem and automating things that probably shouldn't need to be automated :).
        </p>

        <p>
          I aspire to always put passion and love to my projects. I enjoy programming the most out of all the components of my degree. I want to pursue a career in software engineering tackling the hardest challenges.        </p>

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
        <h2>A Journey With Dijktra - Node Graph Maker and Shortest-Path Solver</h2>
        <p>
          Producing node graphs by hand can be a pain, by and or computer. This quick and simple solution allows the user to produce quick graphs, returning the output of the graph and shortest path as a string object.

        <h2>KnowMyGrade - A University Grade Calculator</h2>
        Most university grade calculators either come with too much or too little. KnowMyGrade finds the sweet spot that allows a student to enter all their grade and credit information without clicking through too many windows. Clean and intuitive UI allows for a hassle free input experince. 
        <h2>Automated SMS Notified NHS Referral App</h2>
        <p>
          It's very common for apps to your hospital appointment to be delayed or cancelled, especially during the pandemic. This program allows you to get notification alerts when a free slot is opened up on the NHS Referral website. Inspired by my mother having her appointments cancelled 3 times now, I wanted a quick automated way to make sure I don't miss any openings.

        <h2>ü¶Å Event Participation</h2>
        <h2>Londond Business School Hackathon 2018</h2>
        <p>
          During my time at college, I have attended the London Business School Hackathon. I learnt so many things to list, but its one of my first real experiences under pressure when programming.
        </p>
        <h2>Mozfest 2019</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, I attended Mozfest where me and a few college friends produced a simple alexa app powered by AI to give feedback on your current mood based on some questions. It was simple, but it did gain attraction due to its interactivity and sprouted psychological discussions.
